# simple_walk

This software made a basic tripod gait for our hexapods.

Since we moved to an other backend for the interaction with the hexapods, **we no longer use nor develop this software**. Please refer to [libdynamixel] and [dynamixel_control_hw] for newer software used for our dynamixel-based hexapods.
